# Assignment1
ID Assignment 1 (Due 27th Nov)

This is a portfolio website for the user "John Rupert Herberte". It showcases facts about himself, his academic background and past projects. The intended audience of this website would be potential employers, or people who are interested in working with him. There are three different pages - one for introduction, one for background and one for projects. 

Design process:
I intended to go for a simplistic look, with analogous colors of blue as the overall theme.
As a potential employer, I want to be able to know about his background/projects easily. This is achieved through two buttons placed after the introduction, where a certain 'flow' is established. The employer should read the introduction before moving on to the other sections.

Take a look at the Adobe XD file which represents this website's wireframe, included in the overall files.

Features:
- Navigation buttons to access different pages of the website, with buttons to go back to the original page as well.
- Get suggestions for future projects (benefits the owner of the website), with a required name input and text area function.

Features left to implement:
- A proper navigation bar
- A link to prototypes of projects in the past projects page

Technologies used:
- I used the unDraw plugin in my Adobe XD wireframe to get clean and free illustrations.

Testing:

[Suggestion form]
- Try to submit the form with all input valids and verify that a success message appears
- Submitting the form with empty or invalid inputs has already been tested and proven to show an error message.

index.html and academicBackground.html works and looks fine on both computer screen size and mobile phone screen size. Google chrome and OperaGX displays it perfectly as well.

However, pastProjects does not come out as intended on mobile phone screen sizes. Everything else is fine, on computer screen sizes and various browsers.
