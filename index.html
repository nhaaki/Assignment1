        <h2>My name is John Rupert Herberte.</h2>
        <p>I am 24 years old, and I currently live alone in Singapore. I was originally born in the United States of America, but I recently moved to Singapore for a business venture.</p>
        <p>I have a burning hot passion for teaching, and I find enjoyment out of planning lectures and activities to ensure that my students are able to enjoy and learn what I teach.</p>
        <p>These paragraphs are kind of filler, but this is essentially an introduction to myself to give my potential employers an idea of who I am. I should place my hobbies and interests here, most preferably productive ones that shine an appealing light onto myself.</p>
        <p>Now, you can access the other sections of my portfolio by clicking the buttons below. I would like to thank you for spending time to look at my porfolio, and considering me for the job at all.</p>
